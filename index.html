        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hey, I'm Wojciech. I was born in Bydgoszcz in Poland. I spend there the first 19 years of my life.</p>
        <p> After I completed a four-year technical high school (with a specialization in construction and obtained a
            professional qualification) I moved to Gdansk to study civil engineering (similar to my brother and my mom).
            Got
            a Bachelor and a Masters degree.
        </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Music</strong></li>
            <p>Since I was young I had a dream to be a rockstar. I pretty much knew it will remain a dream.
                Instead I now play by the campfire, parties, sing karaoke which gets me as close to being a rockstar as
                it
                can haha
            </p>
            <li><strong>Working out</strong></li>
            <p>A big chunk of my life. Working out also helps with keeping the plate clean
                (chosing the healthier options over the junkier ones - working out without the assistance of the proper
                nutrition would be shameful).</p>
            <li><strong>Anime & Manga & fantasy books</strong></li>
            <p>This started probably when I was around 10. Hard to put a number of how many series I've watched.
                Nowadays I only stick to the top series of each season :D If I had to recommend one - it has to be
                the one which
                is streaming right now and it is called <a

                    <strong>Solo Leveling</strong>
                </a>

            <li><strong>Traveling</strong></li>
            <p>Thanks to erasmus exchanges I was able to travel most of the Europe in my mid 20s and met lots of people.
                For the past 3 year I've been explringing Asia with my borther:
            <p><strong>Japan</strong>(for obvious reasons..) has exceeded my expectations. The best trip so far.</p>
            <div><img src="images/Korea_3.jpeg" alt="Picture of me wearing a Hanbock in South Korea" width="800"
                    height="480">
            </div>
            <p><strong>South Korea</strong> was almost as good. We flew there because for the last year 90%
                of our Netflix history were K-Dramas..</p>

            </div>
            <p><strong>Thailand</strong> is next one on the list ^^</p>
            </p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>After I graduated from college, I moved to Germany (Kassel) where I worked as a draftsman for 1,5 year.
            When my german improved I got a position as a construction manager, where I worked for 2,5 years.
            I am gratefull for this oportunity since it allowed me to develop my german to a deegree, where I no longer
            feel
            shy or embaressed to speak up. The last year working on a construction site I spent in Berlin, where I quit
            my
            job and looked after IT opportunities. After a few months I got enrolled in a Techstarter IT course which is
            4/12 months completed :)
